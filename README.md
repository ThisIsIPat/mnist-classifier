# MNIST Classifier

Hi!

This is my first on-hands experience with designing a NN from "scratch" (if you can call Keras that, that is).

At the end of the day, this is, however, just another MNIST classifier, one of the many I'm sure are already out there.

This version features a TKinter input canvas, so that you're able to input your own data after training the model.

## Usage

1. Run ``train.py`` to train and save the model.
2. Run ``use.py`` to load and test the model via mouse input. Note that this likely only works on **Windows** / **macOS** due to PIL limitations.

### Have fun!
